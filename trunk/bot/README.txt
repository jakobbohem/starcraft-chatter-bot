compile/run POStagger1.java, then input a string which is tagged in the console window (1 exits)
The tags are hard coded in corpus/wordVals.txt (the other file here isn't used atm)
The program is partitioned in a way that I hope is extensible enough for our needs. the Query class should include better constructors in the future. The Tagger and Interpreter should also get more refined methods as we move along.

This can be the start of the big project program if we want. I use only native Java SE methods so far.

Let me know if you have questions or suggestions. I keep a local copy of these files for now. If we need to get more serious about collaborating on code, we should look into some good way of setting up a source control environment.

Updated Program. Should be a bit better now.
